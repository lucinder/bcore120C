        <h3>A bit on myself, and on Pomegranates</h3>
        <p><em>3 April, 2020/em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to my quaint little myth blog!</p>
        <p>My [current] name is <strong>Sav</strong>, though that’s prone to change. I’ve been meaning to change my name to either <strong>Cinder</strong> (Cid for short) or <strong>Luca</strong> for a few years- thus why my online name is lucinder on a few platforms- I just haven’t been able to decide which one to go with. I use they/them pronouns but refuse to identify by any gender, mainly because gender is overrated as a construct.</p>
        <p>I’m a CSS major, but CSS is honestly one of my more minor interests- I’ve got fixations in just about every field imaginable. In my spare time, I do a lot of field geology, digital (and analog) art, fantasy writing, UI and usability analysis, jazz piano (especially improv), etcetera, and so on, and so forth. Other things I’m interested in include nuclear chemistry, xenobiology, horror webseries + ARGs, marine biology, environmental science, historical fashion, and a whole lotta video games (including but not limited to Earthbound/MOTHER, Pokemon, Final Fantasy, Danganronpa, Yakuza, and Minecraft (except most often modded to the point of no return)).</p>
        <p>Ask me about my opinions on anything, I can literally go on hours-long rants about things as small as the taste of cooked vs dried vs unprepared vegetables or the newest Unearthed Arcana.</p>
        <p>Anyways, with introductions out of the way…</p>
        <br>
        <p>In class on Tuesday, we explored the myth of Hades and Persephone in brief, discussion its relations to the natural cycle of seasons and the traditional coming-of-age tale, but we only touched on the symbolism of the pomegranate. Pomegranates as a fruit tend to find themselves in the position of easy physical metaphors due to a number of unique features: the juicy, edible part of a pomegranate is the rind around its seeds, which are contained within the bulbous fruit. In Ancient Greece, pomegranates were primarily known as the “fruit of the dead” (Graves 1992), yet in later cultures, they were more frequently presented as symbols of fertility (Hudson, 2017). The word pomegranate itself comes from the old French pome grenate, which itself derives from the latin pōmum grānātum, literally meaning “seedy apple”. Like apples, pomegranates are one of the proposed real-life equivalents of the biblical “forbidden fruit,” which draws a parallel between the myth of Adam and Eve and Hades and Persephone- the eating of the fruit is seen as an irreversible decision, perhaps interpretable as a corruption of one’s innocence. In Genesis, Eve is first to devour the fruit before Adam, which further supports the potential of influence of the myth of Persephone on this biblical story.</p>
        <p>As we go on in the quarter, I hope I can talk more about mythological parallels like this between cultures, as these short examples are the foundations of a larger global picture of migration and cultural mixing that lead to a lot of the different sects of modern religion we see today.</p>
