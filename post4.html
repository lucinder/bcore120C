        <br>
        <p> Death is a pretty inevitable thing. Even if we're somehow resurrected and brought into the heavens after we die a la Jesus or Heracles, authors tend to still put emphasis on the tremendous suffering these figures have to go through leading up to or during their death. 
          This, of course, means that with few exceptions, all great heroes will die at some point, and suffer the throes of agony as their body decays and leaves their soul up for judgment. But a common trope within texts that take into account the death of their heroes is to emphasize the tragedy of their death;
          either in the build-up (per the earlier cases, Heracles being burned at the stake and Jesus' crucifixion) or aftermath (eternal torment in some way or another). This is because a death without suffering is textually otiose; it bears no impact on the character of the hero, nor allows for metaphorical elaboration on the hero's sins and punishment thereof.
          The death of a hero is also the perfect opportunity for authors to turn their heroes into tragic heroes, showing the audience just the sheer amount of sacrifices the hero has to make in order to better the world around them. A hero who makes no sacrifices or undergoes no suffering cannot connect with a human audience realistically. A mere paragon of power stands as a god and nothing more; there is nothing mortal or relatable about them.
        </p>
        <p> Theseus' myth is a prime example of this trope. He undergoes his six labors, slays the minotaur, sails home and fully reconstructs his ship all the while, returns as a hero to the Athenian people and establishes the first democracy of Athens, then simply goes about his merry life for a while. At this point in the story, he's reached such an extremity of physical and political power that the audience can no longer relate to him;
            thus, he must be knocked off his metaphorical and/or literal pedestal to accomplish the suffering that reconnects him with the audience of his story. According to Plutarch, Theseus swiftly lost popularity as the Athenian king, and was exiled by his own people. He fled to the island of Scyros, and Lycomedes, fearing that Theseus would dethrone him, pushed the hero off a cliff to kill him. A literal fall from grace.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Of course, if this death were not in and of itself suffering enough, the Greek underworld of Hades is a gloomy place, even for heroes who reside in its Elysian Fields. In <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.11.xi.html">Homer's Odyssey</a>, Achilles says this about being dead: </p>
          <blockquote>
            "'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you have heard anything about my father Peleus- does he still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy- could I but be as I then was and go even for a short time to my father's house, any one who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon me it.'"
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Homer goes on after this to describe specific fates of notably-punished figures like Tityus, Tantalus, and Sisyphus. Bad times all around for that lot. But again, it's in their deaths and fates that we see their lives given metaphorical meaning, and their sins taken account for rather than ignored; it shows a degree of moral and cultural awareness by the authors to prove their own upstanding judgment against history's greatest winners and losers.
          Just how Dante puts Greek heroes in the deepest circles of hell due to his culture's resentment of the Greeks, punishments in all mythos are meted out with respect to the accordance to or violation of cultural codes.
