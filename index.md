## ...There be Dragons.
Welcome to my academic blog for BCORE 120 C. Here, you'll find weekly(?) posts discussing various myths and legends, and their relation to a modern context.

I play a whole lot of [D&D](https://dnd.wizards.com/), so expect a lot of references thereto as well, as Dungeons & Dragons was a revolutionary franchise for a lot of modern interpretations of mythos, normalizing the stories of polytheistic cultures in monotheistic cultural settings that would otherwise consider such material taboo.
