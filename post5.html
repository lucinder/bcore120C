        <blockquote alt="Writing by lucinder!">
          Five men sat around the campfire. When sparks landed on any of them, they didn’t flinch, just kept eating their cans of beans and staring into the flames, seeing a deep, endless sort of expanse to the fire’s roots in scrap wood, comparable to that of a child gazing upon the ocean for the first time. Raccoon-stains of darkness bleared under the mens’ hooded eyelids, their faces illuminated from below like one might with a flashlight to tell spooky stories. Of course, there were no spooky stories to tell here. They were living the ghost story, after all.

“Eddie, you called for backup this morning, right? Yer tellin’ me base wasn’t even able to send a troop?”

“Seems like it, Larryboy. We’re really stuck out here.”

A deep grunt, like a half-sigh, from the older man, as he lay back-down in the sand, averting his gaze from the fire to instead lock with the stars, trying to find something resembling a familiar constellation from his limited well of knowledge thereof.

“If any other squads find us out here, we’re as good as dead.”

“Way to lighten the mood, Casey,” Eddie spat back at him, not meeting eyes with the greenie. The kid’s anxiety would do nothing to help him out in this endless desert, alone and necessarily self-sufficient for the time being.

Larry gazed down momentarily to flash a glare at the two, “If we die here, it’s you two getting the blame. Less talking, more eating.”

The group went silent for a minute or two, some finishing up their rations, some getting just over halfway. It was getting to be a familiar smell, the mix of musk, sweat, and beans. Familiar enough that the taste of beans was starting to be a heinous thing. For those that still cared about taste, at least.

They didn’t expect Larry, the quiet old elder he was, to break the silence, “You kids got girls back at home waiting for you?”

A brief moment of hesitation passed amongst the group, not sure whether to take the old man’s question as a genuine inquiry or a trap, but Eddie spoke up, “…Her name’s Doris. Right lovely lass she is, met her at a ballroom uptown and we hit it off instantly. She wanted to join the medics when she heard I was going off east to serve, but they turned her down.”

“Lucky girl. Joining the medics is a one way ticket to dying young, younger than us ground-boys,” growled the fiercest of the group, a boy with tasseled black hair that fell over his eyes and the scraps of a goatee interrupted by scar lines.

Eddie frowned, “Stay in your damn lane, Jack. She had a dream, and they crushed it. The life expectancy’s got nothin’ to do with it.”

Jack simply rolled his eyes, “Dreams are nothing but delusions. A facsimile of a goal, clouding our eyes from the truth.”

“And what’s the truth, then, poet-boy?” Larry asked languidly.

“The truth?” Jack stopped for a second, thinking, and then shook his head, “Is that we’re all screwed. Unbelievably, irrevocably screwed. We’re not going home. We’ll die here, alone in the desert, forgotten by everyone. If the enemy troops don’t nab us first, it’ll be the water,” he shook his near-empty canteen to demonstrate.

Larry sat up again, giving him a curious look, “Ya think? Well, in that case, no point in holding anything back. Let’s get any unfinished business outta the way before we pass on.”

The men gazed at each other, one by one, thinking to themselves. Eddie took out a tattered journal from his pack and a dull pencil, starting to write, and the fifth boy, who hadn’t spoken thus far, started to hum to himself.

Larry took out a stone from his pack, and gazed down. Casey leaned over to look over his shoulder, and managed to catch a glimpse of a rough inscription on the stone before the old man smacked him away.

<em>Rosie</em>

<em>1967-1970</em>

“Who’s Rosie?” he immediately asked, and Larry sighed annoyedly.

“None of your damned business, greenie.”

“Come on, mate, might as well tell us if these are our last moments together.”

He cast a glare at the younger one, but obliged nonetheless, “…Before I took up this job, I was a chicken farmer. Rosie was my beloved. Female Leghorn, brought good eggs to the table, and loved to be pet on the back of the neck.”

Casey blinked, confused, “A chicken?”

“What about it, greenie?”

“Your beloved was a chicken.”

“As I said. What about it?”

“Nothing, nothing,” Casey quickly looked away, hiding his amusement, “Just… thought you were more of a ladies’ man, you know. You’re the type that could get a whole lot of lovin’ if you wanted.”

“Like you would know anything about ladies, Casey,” Jack cackled from across the fire, to which Casey blushed furiously.

“How ‘bout you, Jack? You got anyone you love?” now focusing on the other boy, Larry shifted his gaze across the flames. Jack seemed taken aback, and for a moment, his eyes filled with a deep sorrow, before he cast that semblance of emotion away and went back to his usual prickly self.

“I don’t need love. I’m a soldier first, person second.”

“Sure you are,” Larry chuckled, “Casey, you know ‘im better, what’s he hiding?”

“W-well, uh,” Casey stammered out, glancing quickly between Larry and Jack, ambivalent on whose trust to betray first, “Jack, uh. Likes his ma, right?”

“Shut yer trap, flower boy,” Jack roared, his hand instinctually falling to his pocket knife.

But Larry gave the feisty one a pointed glare, and his hand left the handle again, setting back down on the desert floor with a defiant “hmph”. Another moment’s pause, and Jack finally came clean.

“Mama runs our tapas shop alone. …<em>Ran</em> our tapas shop alone. Caught some muscle disease, now she can’t walk. I’ve gotta be out on the field to bring in an income for her, to keep her off the streets and alive. That’s why I can’t afford to relax, not for a second. If I die, so will she, and god knows I deserve it, but she doesn’t.”

“I’m sure God’s got a place in heaven for both you and your ma, Jack,” Eddie put down his journal to speak again, using the pencil as a bookmark, “You’re not a bad person, just a man of necessity. Most of us are. ‘Cept Billy over here, no idea what his deal is.”

The fifth, Billy, who had not yet spoken, switched which song he was humming upon hearing his name.

Larry shrugged, “Outta all of us, Big Bill’s at peace. A man who can’t talk but can snipe down a moving target from over a thousand feet away scopeless without so much as a second thought is a man without a care in the world. Y’all should aim to be more like him.”

“The less one has, the better. You’re a damn good wrangler and you’ve got one less arm than the rest of us. Billy’s got no worries ‘cuz he doesn’t have half a brain in that big ‘ol head of his,” Jack grabbed a sprig of desert grass from nearby, twirled it into a tight little strand, and put it between his teeth like a cigarette substitute. Old habits died hard, Larry supposed.

“A toast!” Eddie suddenly held up his empty bean can, “To life, love, and each other! Cheers!”

“Cheers,” agreed the other three that could speak, and all five held up their bean cans to clink over the center of the campfire.

A clink, interrupted by gunshots from the east horizon.

Five bodies were found around the ashes of a campfire.
